#UNIT TESTING
# Generally if we have 100 automation test cases to run, do we execute one test case after another?
# It would be a tiresome process right. So if we have a single click to do all the test cases then it
# would be fine right. Unit testing does this.
# It also generates report for all the test cases after the execution.
# Python Unittest library inherits its root from a third party module known as PyUnit
# Like the JUnit,Python Unittest module
